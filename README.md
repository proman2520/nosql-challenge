# nosql-challenge

In this repository, one will find several items. One will find this README file. One will find the NoSQL_setup.ipynb and 
NoSQL_analysis.ipynb, two starter notebooks that I then used to fill with the necessary code to complete the assignment. 
One will also find the Resources folder which contains the establishments.json, which was imported into MongoDB and used for the 
establishments collection of the uk_food database. 

To complete this assignment, I consulted AskBCS once for help, which ended up being a silly conceptual error on my end.

Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment, and please let me know if there is any glaring errors with my repository.

Best,
Andrew
